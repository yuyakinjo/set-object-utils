# Product Overview

**set-object-utils** is a TypeScript utility library that extends JavaScript's native Map with Set-like operations. It provides high-performance set operations (intersection, union, difference, etc.) while maintaining type safety and tree-shakeable design.

## Key Features

- Extends native Map with set operations
- Both class inheritance (ExtendedMap) and standalone function approaches
- Default value support for missing keys
- Utility methods for filtering and conversion
- Optimized for Bun runtime
- Tree-shakeable exports to minimize bundle size

## Target Use Cases

- Map-based data manipulation requiring set operations
- Performance-critical applications needing efficient Map operations
- TypeScript projects requiring strict type safety
- Applications using Bun runtime for optimal performance
